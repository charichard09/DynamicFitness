            Progressive overload is a principle of exercise training that involves gradually increasing the demands placed on the body during exercise over
            time. The basic idea is that as the body adapts to a particular workload, you need to increase the workload to continue making progress.
              <li>
                Methods of Progression for Endurance/Stability: Master basic movement patterns, Progress exercises proprioceptively
                (add controlled yet unstable modalities), increase complexity, decrease rest, increase reps or sets, increase weight
              </li>
              <li>
                Methods of Progression for Muscular Development: Increase weight, increase reps, increase sets, decrease rest, increase complexity

                Methods of Progression for Maximal Strength: Increase weight, increase sets

              Warm-Ups: A warmup is done prior to a workout session and is used to help prepare the body and mind for physical activity. A warmup is not
              included in your workout but it is recommended to spend 5-10 minutes doing some light cardio and dynamic stretching before your workout.

            Proper form is essential for any exercise or physical activity, whether you are lifting weights, performing bodyweight exercises, or
            engaging in cardio workouts. Proper form ensures that you engage the intended muscles effectively and efficiently, minimize the risk of
            injury, and maximize the benefits of the exercise.

          Bracing or activating your core muscles is an essential technique for performing heavy lifts safely and effectively.
          By bracing your core, you'll create a stable base of support for your spine, which will help prevent injury and allow you to lift heavier weights with greater control and efficiency.
            <li>
              Tighten your abdominal muscles as if you were about to take a punch to the stomach. This will engage your transverse abdominis muscle, which is the deepest layer of abdominal muscle.
