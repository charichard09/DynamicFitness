            What is Stability/Muscular Endurance? 
            <ul>
              <li>The ability to maintain a stable position or posture while moving or holding a position for an extended amount of time. This option is 
                highly recommended for if you selected beginner fitness level, or if it has been more than 3 months since you've trained with this goal 
                in mind, as this option will give you a workout that will strengthen proper movement patterns, stability, mobility, and prepare your body 
                for more advanced exercises.

        <p>Goal alignments are inspired by the National Academy of Sports Medicineâ€™s Optimum Performance Training (OPT) model.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The NASM OPT model is a comprehensive training system that helps fitness professionals design safe and effective exercise programs 
            for their clients.
          </li>
          <li>
            The NASM OPT model is based on the principle of progressive overload, which means gradually increasing the intensity, volume, or 
            complexity of exercises to ensure continued improvements in strength, endurance, and overall fitness. The model is also designed to be 
            flexible and adaptable, allowing fitness professionals to customize exercise programs to meet the unique needs and goals of their clients.
