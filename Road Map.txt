// Firestore security
[Firebase] Client access to your Cloud Firestore database expiring in 4 day(s)
You chose to start developing in Test Mode, which leaves your Cloud Firestore database completely open to the Internet. Because your app is vulnerable to attackers, your Firestore security rules were configured to stop allowing requests after the first 30 days.
In 4 day(s), all client requests to your Firestore database will be denied. Before that time, please write strong security rules that allow your app to function while appropriately protecting your data. Analysis is run daily; if you've modified your rules in the last 24 hours those changes may not be accounted for.

// Start Workout
- Should display the Last Split: worked out for the user to know 
- display rep ranges for each exercise as placeholders i.e. 8-12
- trigger conditional if a user clicks finish workout and any exercise has a majority of sets above or below the rep range
    prompt if the user would like to "add more [weight]" or "add less [weight]" on next workout of this split


// Update workout functionality
- remove an exercise from a workout
- update everything from adding or removing sets, rep amounts
- be able to add an exericse to a workout from db


// filter out similar primaryMuscleGroup exercises
	// randomize filteredWorkoutArray 
	
- proposal: change all exercises to more specific muscle groups,
	then create a primaryMuscleGroupAdded that will get push the muscle group just added
	check if any subsequent muscle groups exis in ...Added array, if yes, skip, if no, add to 
	filteredWorkoutArray


// Display previous workout session
- add details for previous workout sessions


// CSS/UI
- Implement hamburger menu on mobile


// Allow users to write and see previous notes for each exercise


// Add email function that Alex used


// Bugs that need fixing
- page refresh error (new hypohesis: refresh doesnt load fast enough to store necessary data to load page thus generaing error. quick load pages such
as login and createWorkout work with refresh) (old hypothesis: React Router and Firebase Hosting interaction)
- selecting a workout to start then reselecing default "Available Workouts" crashes app


// Error handling
- don't allow users to enter no value, or default to 0 for weight or reps if left empty


// Look at Capstone stretch goals for more
